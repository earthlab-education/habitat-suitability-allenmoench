# # Habitat suitability under climate change
# 
# [Our changing climate is changing where key grassland species can live,
# and grassland management and restoration practices will need to take
# this into
# account.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00730/full)
# 
# In this coding challenge, you will create a habitat suitability model
# for a species of your choice that lives in the continental United States
# (CONUS). We have this limitation because the downscaled climate data we
# suggest, the [MACAv2 dataset](https://www.climatologylab.org/maca.html),
# is only available in the CONUS – if you find other downscaled climate
# data at an appropriate resolution you are welcome to choose a different
# study area. If you don’t have anything in mind, you can take a look at
# Sorghastrum nutans, a grass native to North America. [In the past 50
# years, its range has moved
# northward](https://www.gbif.org/species/2704414).
# 
# Your suitability assessment will be based on combining multiple data
# layers related to soil, topography, and climate. You will also need to
# create a **modular, reproducible, workflow** using functions and loops.
# To do this effectively, we recommend planning your code out in advance
# using a technique such as pseudocode outline or a flow diagram. We
# recommend planning each of the blocks below out into multiple steps. It
# is unnecessary to write a step for every line of code unles you find
# that useful. As a rule of thumb, aim for steps that cover the major
# structures of your code in 2-5 line chunks.
# 
# ## STEP 1: STUDY OVERVIEW
# 
# Before you begin coding, you will need to design your study.

# Understanding grasslands is essential in understanding global carbon sinks. In particular, understanding the layer of soil that lies directly beneath the surface. The presence of Andropogon gerardii, or Big Bluestem, in grassland ecosystems has been significantly connected to the quantity of carbon stored in grassland ecosystems. Where there is more bluestem, there is more stored carbon. How has this changed in recent history - have there been any changes in Bluestem's range? How might Bluestem's range change in the future, given various climate scenarios? 
# 
# In this study, I will examine Bluestem's historical and future range across the Buffalo Gap and Little Missouri national grasslands. I will use several different variables to come up with a suitability raster, which will show areas in which the habitat is suitable for bluestem. I will look at elevation ranges as well as soil variables, and I will combine this with climate projection scenarios to determine ways in which the bluestem's habitat range might change.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Pseudocode outline (by notebooks):
# 
# - Climate_01_gbif: This notebook accesses the species occurrence information for bluestem from the GBIF database.
# - Climate_02_grassland_boundaries: Accesses the grassland boundary polygons from the USFS website. It then selects the specific grasslands for the study using the NationalGR number, and prints the boundaries on top of ESRI map tiles.
# - Climate_03_soil_urls: Compiles a list of urls from the Polaris soil characteristics database. The code selects soil tiles based on the latitude and longitude boundaries of the grassland polygons. Currently this notebook is looking at soil pH values.
# - Climate_03_soil_urls2: This notebook is intended to look at a second set of soil characteristics (soil type).
# - Climate_04_soil_tiles: Prints out the Polaris soil tiles.
# - Climate_05_elevation1: Prints out an SRTM Digital Elevation Model for the Little Missouri national grassland.
# - Climate_05_elevation2: Prints out an SRTM Digital Elevation Model for the Buffalo Gap national grassland.
# - Climate_06_macav2: Runs the maca V2 climate projection scenario.
# - climate_07_fuzzy_logic: Contains the fuzzy logic model from last semester.
# - Climate_07_fuzzy_logic2: Contains the fuzzy logic model from this semester.
# - Climate_08_suitability: Uses raster multiplication to calculate a suitability score for bluestem.

# # Species Overview: Andropogon gerardii (Big Bluestem)
# 
# In terms of global carbon storage and sequestration, soil health is critical. Globally, soil organic carbon holds about 1550 Pg of carbon. Soil inorganic carbon holds about 950 Pg, which together make soil the third largest carbon pool on Earth after the geologic pool (4130 Pg, including fossil fuels) and the oceanic pool (38000 Pg)(Source 1). This figure represents around 80% of the carbon found in terrestrial ecosystems (Source 2).
# 
# In one study, the species Andropogon gerardii, commonly called Big Bluestem, was found to have a positive association with carbon storage, and was used as an indicator species (Source 3).
# 
# Andropogon gerardii habitat characteristics and tolerances:
# - Soil type: Lowland silt and clay loam
# - Soil horizon > 10in
# - elevation: 
#         CO     3,400 to 9,500 feet (1,036-2,896 m)
#         NM     3,500 to 9,000 feet (1,067-2,743 m)
#         MT     3,300 to 4,000 feet (1,006-1,219 m)
#         WY     3,600 to 9,000 feet (1,067-2,743 m)
# (Source 4)
# - Optimal soil temperature: 25C. "Soil temperatures below 20 °C caused significant reductions in foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus(P) concentration". "reduced photosynthetic rates observed at 5 and 10 °C Tsoil" "Net photosynthesis was < 12 /^mol m"^ s"' at 5 and 10 °C Tsoil and > 20 micromol\ m^-2 s^-1 at 15-40 °C.". Based on the graphs in this study, it seems that bluestem would be growth-limited above 30 and below 20 degrees C, and severely limited outside 15-35 degrees. (Source 5)
# - min soil temp -15C (source 8)
# - well drained or moist soil, full sun (Source 8)
# - Precip: 10-60mm / yr (source7)
# - pH range: 6.0-7.5 (source 10). Another source (11) says that it does fine with pH 5.5, so we'll use this as out lower-range tolerance. Optimal then is 6.5 (halfway)

# ### Climate models
# 
# There is a great deal of uncertainty among the many global climate
# models available. One way to work with the variety is by using an
# **ensemble** of models to try to capture that uncertainty. This also
# gives you an idea of the range of possible values you might expect! To
# be most efficient with your time and computing resources, you can use a
# subset of all the climate models available to you. However, for each
# scenario, you should attempt to include models that are:
# 
# -   Warm and wet
# -   Warm and dry
# -   Cold and wet
# -   Cold and dry
# 
# for each of your sites.
# 
# To figure out which climate models to use, you will need to access
# summary data near your sites for each of the climate models. You can do
# this using the [Climate Futures Toolbox Future Climate Scatter
# tool](https://climatetoolbox.org/tool/Future-Climate-Scatter). There is
# no need to write code to select your climate models, since this choice
# is something that requires your judgement and only needs to be done
# once.
# 
# If your question requires it, you can also choose to include multiple
# climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, and/or
# multiple emissions scenarios, such as RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.

# ## STEP 4: DEVELOP A FUZZY LOGIC MODEL
# 
# A fuzzy logic model is one that is built on expert knowledge rather than
# training data. You may wish to use the
# [`scikit-fuzzy`](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/) library, which
# includes many utilities for building this sort of model. In particular,
# it contains a number of **membership functions** which can convert your
# data into values from 0 to 1 using information such as, for example, the
# maximum, minimum, and optimal values for soil pH.

# <pre><code>1. Research S. nutans, and find out what optimal values are for each variable you are using (e.g. soil pH, slope, and current climatological annual precipitation). 
# 2. For each **digital number** in each raster, assign a **continuous** value from 0 to 1 for how close that grid square is to the optimum range (1=optimal, 0=incompatible). 
# 3. Combine your layers by multiplying them together. This will give you a single suitability number for each square.
# 4. Optionally, you may apply a suitability threshold to make the most suitable areas pop on your map.</code></pre></div></div>
# 
# > **Tip**
# >
# > If you use mathematical operators on a raster in Python, it will
# > automatically perform the operation for every number in the raster.
# > This type of operation is known as a **vectorized** function. **DO NOT
# > DO THIS WITH A LOOP!**. A vectorized function that operates on the
# > whole array at once will be much easier and faster.
